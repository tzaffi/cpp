 *Surrounded Regions
        Difficulty: Medium

        Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

For example,

X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
        After running your function, the board should be:

X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X

*/

struct Node{
    Node(char kind, )
    char kind; // 'X', 'O' or 'B'
    int i;
    int j;
};

class Solution {
public:
    void solve(vector<vector<char>>& board) {

    }
};

int main(){
    cout << "Surrounded Regions aka Depth First Search";

    return 0;
}
