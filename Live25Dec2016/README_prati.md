## HR's instructions:

We have designed this test to take around 2 hours, but weâ€™d like you to take as much time as you need to produce something you are proud of within a day.

Attached you will find the details of the project, which outlines the problem you will be tasked with solving. Everything should be fairly straightforward.


We ask that you include the following when submitting your solution:

* Source code and any comments
* Compiled binary
* Details on which platform to execute/compile on
* Any comments you might have

Good luck!
