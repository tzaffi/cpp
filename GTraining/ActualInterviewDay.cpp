 * Problems that I was actually asked during my 5 interview sessions.

1. Interview - determine the majority within a given the list of numbers.
        Range size would be fastest way
        any different approaches as you can
            recursive approach
            sorting approach : radix sort
            hashset approach
            write one approach whichever you think

2. Designing an abstract data type that keeps track of which sectors in the disk are empty.
        Hard disk imagine as a long array
        Operations get function (next_empty)
        set function (makes the sector as not empty)
   Find a better implementation which does it more efficiently

3. Create a system which identifies everything on internet like a pdf, word, etc uniquely. [Systems question]
        Gravtitated towards creating a process which creates a unique number assign a number

4. Given an array of numbers that are increasing in the begining and decreasing in the mountain.
 Find the peak in better time than linear.

5. If you have a web crawler need to store the urls. You might discover 10 trillion urls. [systems question]
        Cost estimate
            space is taken - break it up
            distributed approach
            what happens if you have run out of space.
            what if it grows to more than 10 trillion urls
